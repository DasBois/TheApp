    <p class="text">
        Inner-City Arts uses arts education to positively affect the lives of inner-city children, improving their chances to lead productive and successful lives by developing creativity, improving learning skills and building self-confidence.
Its unique approach to arts education brings elementary, middle and high school students, educators, families and the community to Inner-City Arts' award-winning campus--an oasis of creativity and learning in one of the nation's poorest neighborhoods--to work with professional teaching artists in well-equipped studios and performance spaces.
